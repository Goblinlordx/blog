Welcome to DevKatBlog! This is a place which I have set up for sharing various ideas and as a place for me to experiment. Broadly, it is intended to focus on various software engineering experiments and ideas as well as explorations concerning philosophical ideas.

I am proficient in a wide range of languages but I have a particular fondness for Javascript and Typescript. Javascript was the first language I worked with professionally and so holds a special place in my heart. The source code for this blog can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/Goblinlordx/blog).

In my spare time, I enjoy expanding his knowledge base relating to programming, reading both fiction and non-fiction, board games, and exploring many abstract philisophical topics.
